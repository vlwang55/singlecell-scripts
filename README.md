# singlecell-scripts
My single cell RNA and RNA/ATAC scripts for people who are new to single cell analysis

I would recommend running through scmultiome.R if you're new because it has the most detailed explanations and only deals with one sample. You can ask me for a sample dataset.

## objectintegration.R
If you have more than one sample that you need to integrate, use objectintegration.R. This includes scripts for integrating one or more scRNA samples as well as one or more scMultiome (RNA+ATAC) samples. Also importantly, it gives you information on how to subset a portion of your integrated object and renormalize. This method also works for subsetting a non-integrated object. 

## misc.R

## pseudotimetrajectory.R
Contains scripts for Monocle3 and Slingshot.
